# Trucker Game

This was mainly a learning project to try Unity's 3D functionalities and make a delivery game.
Initially I wanted to make a game where a driver had to manouver an articulated lorry around the streets of a city but this turned out to be more complicated than imagined due to the calculations and physics involved in having a trailer that followed a tractor realistically.

This lead to a change in motives - I wanted to try out a lot of different functionalities such as driving, UI, map making, procedural generation ( of waypoints and missions ).

For this project I used a variety of free assets for the driving mechanics, vehicles, roads and map making which I found on the unity store.
The script files which I wrote for this project are in the folder [Assets/Scripts](Assets/Scrpts)
