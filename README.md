# trucker-game
A repo for my game to switch between computers
<h1>Trucker Game</h1>
<p>
This was mainly a learning project to try Unity's 3D functionalities and make a delivery game.<br><br>
Initially I wanted to make a game where a driver had to manouver an articulated lorry around the streets of a city but this turned out to be more complicated than imagined due to the calculations and physics involved in having a trailer that followed a tractor realistically.
<br><br>
This lead to a change in motives - I wanted to try out a lot of different functionalities such as driving, UI, map making, procedural generation ( of waypoints and missions ).
